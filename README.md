AdBlock Extension For Chrome
Using a very small amount of code you can create your own adblocker.

The main area is in the URLS section every URL you add will be blocked. This extension is a quick and easy way to block ad sites not blocked by other Adblock programs. I did not publish this to install it makes sure chrome or edge is in developer mode.
